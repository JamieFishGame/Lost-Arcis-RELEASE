Hello! I'm Jamie M, and this is the demo to Lost Arcis.

Lost Arcis is a puzzle metroidvania with a retro asthetic. The gameplay is based around exploration and puzzle solving, with a focus on cyphers. The language of the game is not known at first, but it can be decyphered through exploration of the Arcis.

Lost Arcis has been under development for around a year at the time of this demo releasing, although for the majoirty of it's developemnt it went by the name "Currently Unnamed Maze Game." As this is a demo to the game, more is planned to be added for the full release.

Thank you for trying Lost Arcis! Feedback is much appreicated.
